Make pawns try to avoid certain areas, such as filth-generating terrain or configured doors.

In vanilla game, pawns do not mind walking through a freezer, other pawn's bedroom, or cutting a corner
of a paved path. This mod implements the following features:

- Filth avoidance. All terrain that generates filth will be perceived as more costly to walk and pawns
will try to avoid them if a clean path is nearby.
- Door avoidance. Each door can have a priority set. Pawns will try to avoid using 'Side Door' doors,
and will use 'Emergency Door' doors only if it is the only way or the alternative is very costly.

(These match the non-performance features from the 'Clean Pathfinding 2' mod.)

These rules apply only to non-animal colonists or non-hostile visitors. Certain exceptions apply,
such as being drafted, bleeding severely or carrying another pawn.
